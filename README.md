Low-code modeling capabilities dramatically enrich cplace and reduce the need for customer-specific hard-coded solutions. By using Low-Code, you can generate value much faster and more cost-effectively.

Power users and solution architects with basic programming knowledge are able to implement logic and processes with cplaceJS inside the user interface, at runtime in the existing infrastructure.

On the following pages you will find recipe-like examples that show you how to use cplaceJS effectively.

You will also find a detailed API description for all cplaceJS usages.

Please note that this documentation as well as the Low-Code features of cplace are still in progress. We will regularly add new API's, functions and of course documentation and examples.
